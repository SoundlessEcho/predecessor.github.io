STEP 1: Prepare your image
    •    Make sure your image is saved on your computer (like me.jpg, logo.png, etc.)
    •    It’s best to keep the file name short and lowercase (no spaces).
Example: profile.jpg, banner.png


STEP 2: Upload it to your GitHub repo
    
Go to your repository on GitHub (the one named yourusername.github.io)
Click “Add file” → “Upload files”
Drag your image into the upload box
(You can create a folder called images if you want to keep things organized — not required but recommended.)
    
Scroll down and click Commit changes

Your image is now stored online in your repo.


STEP 3: Find the image URL

Once uploaded:
    
Click on your image in GitHub
Click the “View raw” button or in the address bar at the top of your browser, you’ll see that link includes /blob/.
To make it work directly, simply replace the word blob with raw.
Copy the URL from your browser’s address bar.


STEP 4: Add it to your HTML

Now open your index.html in GitHub and edit it.
    
Click the file name index.html
Click the pencil icon (✏️) near the top-right to edit
Find where you want the image to appear — for example, under your “About” section
Add this line of HTML:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io/main/profile.jpg" 
     alt="My profile picture" 
     style="width:200px;border-radius:10px;">


(If you didn’t make an images folder, just use src="profile.jpg" instead.)
    
Scroll down and click Commit changes
